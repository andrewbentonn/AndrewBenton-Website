        <div class="subheading mb-5">Creative Writing MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a student at University of California Riverside majoring in Creative Writing. I've had no job experience, but because I have my hands full with college, however, that doesn't mean that I have zero experience with doing hard work. In my free time I like to read various genres of literature, play video games of the story-telling nature, and lift weights to keep myself healthy and in shape.<br><br>
        Going back to my major, Creative Writing, I am still in the middle of figuring out what I would like to do with it, but what I do know is that I plan on writing stories in some way shape or form that will hopefully influence and colour the world of thousands of people all over the globe. <br><br>
        What I would like to bring to my work space is a positive, productive and helpful attitude that will help the environment thrive and get things done and done right. Learning is something that I will do for the rest of my life so I will never shy away from new learning experiences, in fact I will welcome them with open eyes and ears because it would surely become a strength later on in life. Iâ€™ve had minor exposure to programs such as Microsoft Word and the like, so I am somewhat knowledgeable on how to do various things such as creating tables, graphing data, and making fliers. I am also proud to say that I am no slacker when it comes to physical labour and I love to push myself to my limits. I have disciplined myself through weightlifting to do so and so my stamina and strength are above average. Iâ€™ve had experience with advertising -- going door to door to sell a product -- specifically with my highschool football team for fundraising. I managed to meet their quota, therefore, I am proud to say that I have satisfactory performance in that area as well. Working in groups or solo, I can do either. I personally find myself to be highly adaptive to my environment and towards others in order to fit in and become a somewhat amiable and respected individual. This goes hand in hand with some of my morals, one of which is to respect others no matter what and to remain level-headed in situations that could provoke the wrong choices. Though Iâ€™ve never had job experience, I have the experience for a job is what I would like to highlight.
